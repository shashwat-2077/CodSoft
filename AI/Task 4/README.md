**How Does it Work?**
The project combines collaborative filtering techniques and string similarity calculations to provide you with personalized movie recommendations. 

**Here's how it works:**

**Data Magic**: It starts by loading movie data and user ratings data. Then, it merge them to create a user-item matrix, where rows represent users, columns represent movie titles, and values represent user ratings.

**Cosine Similarity**: It calculates the cosine similarity between movies, creating an item-item similarity matrix. This matrix helps us identify which movies are similar to each other.

**User Input**: You tell the model your favorite movie (e.g., "Titanic").

**Recommendations**: The model uses fuzzy string matching to find the closest matching movie in our database. Then, it recommends movies that are similar to your input. The more you like the input movie, the more the system understands your taste!

**Why is this Exciting?**

ðŸŒŸ **Personalized Recommendations**: Discover movies that match your preferences.
ðŸ§© **Fuzzy Matching**: Even if you have a slight typo in the movie title, our system will find the right match.
ðŸŽ¯ **Customizable**: You can adjust the number of recommendations and similarity threshold.

Whether you're a movie buff or just looking for something new to watch, give it a try! Share your favourite movie, and itâ€™ll recommend something you'll love. The experiences I've had and the lessons I've learned will undoubtedly shape my career path in a positive way !! Stay tuned for more updates and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or ideas for collaboration.
